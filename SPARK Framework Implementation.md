This milestone tracks the adoption and rollout of the SPARK (Seek–Play–Apply–Research–Know) pedagogical framework as the institution's core system for curiosity-driven learning in psychologically safe, minimally supervised environments.

### SPARK Phases

- **Seek**: Learners identify personal interests, questions, or problems to pursue, initiated by intrinsic curiosity with no predefined outcomes.
- **Play**: Learners explore ideas through low-stakes experimentation, hands-on engagement, and creative interaction, normalizing failure.
- **Apply**: Learners put emerging understanding into practice in real-world or simulated contexts, with self-assessed effectiveness.
- **Research**: Learners intentionally deepen understanding by seeking external knowledge, comparing approaches, and refining models based on evidence (placed after Apply for relevance).
- **Know**: Learners internalize, articulate, and demonstrate mastery through explanation, teaching, or transfer, focusing on usable understanding.

### Foundational Principle

Psychological and physical safety as a precondition, managed structurally to enable free exploration without fear.

### Integrated Program Components

- **CRC Pedagogy Research Team**: Conducts ongoing research, evidence gathering, and framework refinement to ensure effectiveness and iterations.
- **Curiosity Supervisors**: Oversee environments to maintain safety, acting as designers who support exploration without direct instruction.
- **Curiosity Camp**: Provides immersive, extended experiences for full SPARK cycles in dedicated settings focused on deep autonomous projects.
- **Curiosity Coach**: Offers personalized guidance to navigate phases while preserving learner autonomy.
- **Spark Sessions**: Short activities to ignite initial curiosity, serving as entry points to the Seek phase.

These components support the cyclical SPARK process, bridging autonomy with rigor across age groups and institutional design.

### Comparison to Other Models

| Model              | Primary Driver       | Role of Adult          | Structure |
|--------------------|----------------------|------------------------|-----------|
| Traditional School | Curriculum           | Instructor             | Linear    |
| Montessori         | Prepared environment | Guide                  | Structured|
| Waldorf            | Developmental stages | Storyteller            | Rhythmic  |
| SPARK              | Learner curiosity    | Environment designer   | Cyclical  |

### Why SPARK Is Strong

- Action-based rather than theoretical
- Acronym is meaningful and natural
- Works across age groups
- Scales from informal to institutional
- Legible to parents, boards, and regulators
- Distinct from other models without antagonism

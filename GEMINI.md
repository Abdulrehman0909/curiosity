## Project Overview

This is a static HTML website for Ignite Curiosity, a non-profit organization focused on STEAM education. The website is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and uses several front-end libraries for styling and functionality. There is no build process or package manager involved.

## Running the Application

To run the website, you can open the `index.html` file in a web browser. For development, it is recommended to serve the files using a simple local HTTP server to ensure all resources are loaded correctly. You can use the following Python command for this:

```bash
python -m http.server
```
